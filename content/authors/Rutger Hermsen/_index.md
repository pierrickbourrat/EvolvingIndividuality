<h2 style="color: #050505; text-align: left;">Lessons on abstract theory from a concrete computational model of the evolution of altruism</h2>

To formalize evolutionary thought, a range of abstract mathematical theories has been proposed. A key strength of such abstract theories is their potential generalityâ€”their applicability across diverse systems and situation.  Some results are even claimed to be fully general.  One way to evaluate such claims is to apply the theories to computational models. In practice, this often uncovers conceptual complications.  In particular, the challenge frequently lies in defining appropriate correspondence rules to match the mathematical structures of the theory with measurable quantities in the simulation model.
 
To illustrate this, we present a simple individual-based model in which altruistic organisms spontaneously self-organize into spatially separated colonies that themselves reproduce by binary fission and hence behave as Darwinian entities in their own right.  This model provides a fertile ground to study and apply various formal theories on the evolution of social traits and transitions of individuality.
